		<description><![CDATA[Matt, It was an awesome surprise to wake up and see you had commented here.

I just want to say 2 things while I have the chance:

1. Thanks for Trainyard, I spent countless hours playing it.  Definitely my personal favorite iPhone game.
2. We read your posts meticulously while trying to figure out how we were going to handle sales and such.  You seemed to be one of the few who gave a good amount of insight to the entire process (even if it was for an entirely different platform)

iOS is coming, we have a lot to learn :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great post! I can really see the similarity between your story and my experiences with Trainyard. I&#039;d love to try your game, so definitely consider brining it to iOS at some point :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[To &quot;combat&quot; piracy, try contacting some of the pirate forums and other pirate websites (which don&#039;t have everyone uploading apks)

Some of them are quite cooperative in this case. Well, not for the forums that have been there for years but rather dedicated Android piracy sites. They like the developers and if you show that you&#039;re not a bigshot company, they kinda understand :)]]></description>
