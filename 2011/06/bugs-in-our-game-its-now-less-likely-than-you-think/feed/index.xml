		<description><![CDATA[Hi Guys,
 Thanks for the great game, I really enjoy the challenge/s
 I have a question: I am stuck on sector 3 level 20, and am coming to the conclusion that it is either fiendishly difficult, and thus perhaps out of sequence of difficulty, or it is unsolvable. Neither of these options seems likely in light of the work you write of in your notes, SO.... what about making the solutions available somehow?
 Alternatively could you please clarify how &quot;hints&quot; works, because I cannot get it to work on my HTC Desire S. This suggests an expanded list of instructions.
 Another thing which would be very helpful to older players such as myself, who use small screens, is an enlarged/able font. I am unable to read the instructions attached to new features (eg when switches first appear) or even the toolbar labels, which by the way do not work. 

  Now I have a suggestion, made with FULL respect to your creativity... when a laser goes white.. &quot;dead&quot; as you call it, if we could re-diverge this white beam it would enable a &quot;transport&quot; option where a combined white beam could be used to create a new start point elsewhere in the board for all the combines colours, moreso via wormholes.
 A FIBRE object might further expand your possibilities too, bypassing blocks and other objects and/or &quot;transporting&quot; beams as suggested above, like movable wormholes, kinda.

 Keep up the great work]]></description>
