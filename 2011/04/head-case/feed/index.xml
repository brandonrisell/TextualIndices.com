		<description><![CDATA[Thanks :), we&#039;re excited.

Yeah, we completely agree. We&#039;ve been worried about turning people off to the game because of pricing, but what we figured was that if people played the lite version and enjoyed it, then they would be more understanding of a price higher than $0.99.

Something that struck us as justifying $2.99 was our desire to continue development and updates well after release. Not only to bring in new players, but also to provide current players plenty of varied content. Refraction&#039;s game mechanics allow for so many different level designs and the ability to easily introduce new game mechanics that we see great potential for growth.

Thanks for the purchase, feel free to get ahold of us with any input or concerns about the game :).

		<description><![CDATA[Grats on the release! Purchased. :D

Posting this here cause I don&#039;t want to clutter up your release post with a debate about pricing!

I think of all the prices you suggested earlier you chose the right one.  My friend and I would have paid more because we love it but I think any higher than it is would have been off-putting to new comers before they&#039;d tried the lite version.  Any lower would have been under valuing it.  Spot on I reckon.

Hope it sells well!]]></description>
