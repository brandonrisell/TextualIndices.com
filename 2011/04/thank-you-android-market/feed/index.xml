		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s awesome! I have been watching appbrain, but I didn&#039;t think to check the &#039;hot today&#039; pages or anything like that. I checked out the&#039; hot today&#039; page today and we&#039;re down a ways, but we&#039;re on there! so that&#039;s pretty exciting. Thanks for the heads up Mark :).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I can&#039;t help with the Market but it was listed in the Appbrain.com &#039;Currently hot Brain and Puzzle games&#039; RSS Feed on April 1st!

It&#039;s a great game - I can&#039;t wait for the full version with more levels!]]></description>
